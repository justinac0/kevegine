# Kevin Engine
This project serves as a tool for learning the process of developing simple game engines. This project is written in C, but I aim to implement some sort of Lua scripting support for the game development side of the engine.

# Building
Currently there is only support for building on Linux.

# Linux
You will need `gnu-make` / most other make derivatives and `gcc` installed
&nbsp;
Run `make all` in root directory to build.
Run `make clean` to remove built executable.
